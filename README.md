# Ising_Model_Julia
Implementation of Monte Carlo methods to numerically solve the 1D and 2D Ising models.

The two scripts Ising1D.jl and Ising2D.jl implement the Wolff and Metropolis algorithms to generate thermodynamic data for the system given a range of temperatures.
All simulations assume no external magnetic field.

The scripts generate data for internal energy, specific heat capacity, and magnetization of the system. The scripts also compute the exact values for the aforementioned quantities.

Scripts also plot the data.
