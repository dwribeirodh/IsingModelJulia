Set params for running the 2D Ising simulation using the Metropolis algorithm.
This config file will be read by the Ising2D.jl script to run the simulation
It will then generate equilibrium configurations and thermodynamic data.
If you have any more questions, email ribei040@umn.edu
Make sure you are within the correct folder to run the simulation.

Set below params after the equals sign.

--- Simulation Temperature Range ---
the range of temperatures to be sampled using Metropolis algorithm.

T_sim_initial_value=1.0

T_sim_final_value=5.0

T_sim_step_size=0.1



--- Exact Temperature Range ---
the range of temperatures to be used in calculating the exact solutions.

T_exact_initial_value=1.00

T_exact_final_value=5.00

T_exact_step_size=0.01



--- epoch ---
the number of spins to be flipped during the simulation. This is defined as the
number of time steps in the simulation. Important to notice that the burnout
region of the Markov chain is preset to be the first 80% of configurations.

epoch=100000000



--- frequency ---
the frequency to which compute thermodynamic quantities. Important to note that
this frequency will only take place after the burnout region.

freq=1000000




--- lattice length ---
the side length of the square lattice to simulate.

L=512



--- perBC ---
This will determine whether the simulation will
have periodic or fixed boundary conditions.
For fixed boundary conditions, type "fixed" after bc_type.
For periodic boundary conditions, type "periodic" after bc_type.

bc_type=periodic



--- Algorithm ---
Determine whether to run the simulation using Metropolis or Wolff
algorithms. Type "metropolis" for the metropolis algorithm,
type "wolff" for wolff algorithm

ag=metropolis
